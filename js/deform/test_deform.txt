How to use?
===========

JS
--

You can import ``deform_js`` from ``js.deform`` and ``need``
it where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.deform import deform_js
  >>> deform_js.need()

CSS
---

You can import ``deform_css`` from ``js.deform`` and ``need``
it where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.deform import deform_css
  >>> deform_css.need()

All
---

You can import ``deform`` from ``js.deform`` and ``need``
it where you want these resources to be included on a page::

  >>> from js.deform import deform
  >>> deform.need()

Auto-needing Resources
----------------------

You can avoid needing to manually import and ``need()`` each
Fanstatic dependency of your ``Deform`` form by use of the ``auto_need``
function provided in this package.

  >>> import js.deform
  >>> import colander
  >>> import deform

  >>> schema = colander.Schema()
  >>> form = deform.Form(schema)
  >>> js.deform.auto_need(form)

By doing the above, any widget requirements - including those of `Deform`
itself - will be included for Fanstatic.

So, you may have a form that requires a ``deform.widget.RichTextWidget``
for one of its fields.  This type of widget requires resources relating to
`TinyMCE`.  ``js.deform.auto_need`` will use ``js.tinymce`` for this
requirement.

This is all best illustrated in the following example.

Initialise Fanstatic so we can see resources being included:

  >>> import fanstatic
  >>> dummy = fanstatic.init_needed()
  >>> len(fanstatic.get_needed().resources())
  0

Create a demonstration schema and form:

  >>> schema = colander.Schema()
  >>> node = colander.SchemaNode(colander.String(),
  ...                            widget=deform.widget.RichTextWidget())
  >>> schema.add(node)
  >>> form = deform.Form(schema)

Check the form's resource requirements:

  >>> form.get_widget_requirements()
  [('deform', None), ('tinymce', None)]

Ask ``auto_need`` to include the resources for us:

  >>> js.deform.auto_need(form)

So we can now see the resources that have been included:

  >>> needed = fanstatic.get_needed()
  >>> needed.resources()
  [<Resource 'css/beautify.css' in library 'deform'>, <Resource 'css/form.css' in library 'deform'>, <Resource 'jquery.js' in library 'jquery'>, <Resource 'tiny_mce_src.js' in library 'tinymce'>, <Resource 'scripts/deform.js' in library 'deform'>]

The above resources will automatically be included on your page once
Fanstatic is configured accordingly.
